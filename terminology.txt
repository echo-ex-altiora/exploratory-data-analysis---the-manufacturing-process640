UID: Unique identifier of the machining session
product_ID: Product specific serial number

Type: Quality of the product being created (L, M, or H, for low, medium and high quality products)

air temperature [K]: Average air temperature in the room during the process (in Kelvin)
process temperature [K]: Average air temperature the machine was operating at during production (in Kelvin)
Rotational speed [rpm]: Average revolutions per minute the tool was operating at
Torque [Nm]: Torque generated by the tool in Newton-meters
Tool wear [min]: The current minutes of wear on the tool. H, M and L product manufacturing cause 5/3/2 minutes of tool wear.

machine failure: Label that indicates, whether the machine failed this particular run

TWF (tool wear failure): Failure in the process due to the tool wearing out
head dissipation failure (HDF): Lack of heat dissipation caused the process failure
power failure (PWF): Failure in the process due to lack of power from the tool to complete processing
overstrain failure (OSF): Failure due to the tool overstraining during the process
random failures (RNF): Failures in the process which couldn't be categorised
